/* 
1. Use the Math.random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
2. Multiply the result by 10 and use Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number.
3. Print the random number using console.log() with a message like: "Your random number is 4." 
*/

/*Practice*/
let random = Math.random()*10;

let round = Math.floor(random);

console.log("Your random number is "+ round);
